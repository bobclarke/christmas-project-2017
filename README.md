# christmas-project-2017

## Overview

Build a set of VMS I'm aws with terrarform

Set these up as a kubernetes cluster

On this cluster run a bunch of containers for Jenkins, splunk, sonar, prometheus, selenium grid (ie everything you  would need for automated testing)

write a reference app (nothing fancy and I haven't yet decided which language) and test it on this platform.

The aim is to:
* Build on the BDD testing learned recently.

* learn kubernetes and while I'm at it throw in a bit of Splunk and prometheus

* try out Spinaker and chaos monkey if I get time
