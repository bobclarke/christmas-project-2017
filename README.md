## Overview

Build a set of VMS I'm aws with terrarform

Set these up as a kubernetes cluster

On this cluster run a bunch of containers for Jenkins, splunk, sonar, prometheus, selenium grid (ie everything you  would need for automated testing)

write a reference app (nothing fancy and I haven't yet decided which language) and test it on this platform.

The aim is to:
* Build on the BDD testing stuff  I learned here in my first two weeks. Not sure if I mentioned it but I worked with a really good QA for that period and it was a real revelation. This being the case I want to really get to grips with this while area.

* learn kubernetes and while I'm at it throw in a bit of Splunk  (which I've been using for a few days and am seriously impressed) and prometheus  (which I've never used)

As an a aside I want to try out Spinaker if I get time
